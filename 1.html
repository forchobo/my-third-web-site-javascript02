    <h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">(HyperText Markup Language)</a> is a <strong>markup language that tells <u>web</u> browsers</strong> how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the following line of text.</p>
      <img src="coding.jpg" width="100%">
      <p style="margin-top:40px">HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as and directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as and surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page. </p>
