      <span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use <span class="js">JavaScript</span> on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute the code on users' devices.    <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the <span>ECMAScript</span> standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
